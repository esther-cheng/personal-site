              I am a computer science and psychology double major who loves to
              meet people, learn about their interests, and listen to their life
              stories. I am also an avid crocheter (you can check out some of my

              I am currently a student developer at the Duke University
              Innovation Co-Lab, where I hold office hours and work on exciting
              projects. This semester, I am working on a website for the Duke
              Bluesmith, which provides specialty 3D printing services for the

              What I've Been Up To
            </h3>
            <p className="about-me-blurb">
              I just finished an internship with Deutsche Bank where I worked
              with the Global Receipts Platform team to further develop robust
              message handling and discard logic for pending DTC events. I also
              designed an ESG analytics microservice for Deutsche Bank document
              analysis!
            </p>
            <p className="about-me-blurb">
              This semester, I will be taking Psychology of Cooperation
              (PSY340S), Leadership and Collaboration (SOC227), Personality and
              Individual Differences (PSY321S), Warping Time in Fiction and Film
              (CINE190S), and Intro to Weightlifting (PHYSEDU113).
            </p>
            <p className="about-me-blurb">
              I'll also be TAing Computer Architecture (CS/ECE250) for the
              fourth semester. I loved learning about the mechanisms behind
              technology, and Iâ€™m excited I get to teach it, too!
